  description: >
    Our lab develops advanced controlled environment agriculture (CEA) systems
    including smart greenhouses and vertical plant factories. We integrate
    architectural design, climate engineering, and crop science to create
    production environments that maximize resource efficiency while maintaining
    optimal growing conditions year-round.
  topics:
    - Smart Greenhouses
    - Plant Factories
    - Vertical Farming
    - Resource Efficiency
    - Climate Engineering

  title: "Plant Growth & Physiology"
  tagline: "Growth responses under environmental conditions"
  description: >
    We study plant physiological responses to environmental stimuli including
    light quality and quantity, temperature regimes, CO₂ concentration, and
    nutrient availability. Our research connects fundamental plant biology
    with practical cultivation strategies to optimize growth, development,
    and quality of horticultural crops.
  topics:
    - Photomorphogenesis
    - Light Responses
    - Crop Physiology
    - Growth Modeling
    - Environmental Stress

  tagline: "Sensor integration and automated control systems"
  description: >
    Our team designs and deploys integrated sensor networks and automated
    control systems for precision environment management. We develop real-time
    monitoring platforms that combine temperature, humidity, light, and gas
    sensors with intelligent feedback controllers to maintain ideal growing
    conditions with minimal human intervention.
  topics:
    - IoT Sensors
    - Feedback Control
    - Real-time Monitoring
    - Automation

  title: "Data-driven Production Optimization"
  tagline: "Modeling and analytics for yield improvement"
  description: >
    We apply data science, machine learning, and statistical modeling to
    optimize plant production systems. By analyzing large-scale environmental
    and growth datasets, we build predictive models that guide decision-making
    for irrigation scheduling, nutrient management, harvest timing, and
    overall system design to improve yields and reduce waste.
  topics:
    - Machine Learning
    - Predictive Modeling
    - Yield Optimization
    - Data Analytics
    - Decision Support
